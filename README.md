# Remove image's backgroud

I had to reamove an image background so instead of spending 2 minutes
doing it with an online tool, I spent 30 minutes to make a python
script that prompts a nice interative menu to select the image file
that you want to remove the background.

At least I've fixed some python problems in my PC.

## How to use it

1. Install requirements:

```shell
pip installl -r requirements.txt
```

2. Place the image(s) you want to remove the background in this folder and

3. Run the script

```shell
python remove_bg.py
```

4. In the menu that will appear, select the file you want to remove the
   background. The new image will be in this same directory.
